                <p class="articleSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the
                    acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.
                    Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research.
                    Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate
                    themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a
                    formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The
                    methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

                    quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem
                    solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right
                    to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives
                    aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.</p>

                <p class="articleSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                    knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                    orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation
                    to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                    through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                    Kingdom.[2]</p>
